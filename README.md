#JustParkChallenge
JustPark API for Android Project

Approaching the Problem

API Request and Parsing the JSON
The JustPark API is being requested on the JSONTask method by using HttpURLConnection in order to make a POST request to the url provided. The title of the available parking spot is stored on a Hashmap (as the key) and the langitude/latitude is stored within the hashmap (As the key) in a form of arraylist. While the desired location is stored in a form of ArrayList of double.

UI Prespective
The desired location is marked with a blue pin while the available parking spots are marked with a red pin. The location title is also displayed on the Google Maps library marker pin. All the logos and the pictures were made by Adobe Photoshop.
