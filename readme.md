Approaching the Problem

API Request and Parsing the JSON
The JustPark API is being requested on the JSONTask method by using HttpURLConnection in order to make a POST request to the url provided. The title of the available parking spot is stored on a Hashmap (as the key) and the langitude/latitude is stored within the hashmap (As the key) in a form of arraylist. While the desired location is stored in a form of ArrayList of double.

UI Prespective
The desired location is marked with a blue pin while the available parking spots are marked with a red pin. The location title is also displayed on the Google Maps library marker pin. All the logos and the pictures were made by Adobe Photoshop.
